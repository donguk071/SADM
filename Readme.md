## Introduction  

Large-scale 3D point cloud datasets are essential for training deep neural networks but impose heavy computational burdens. We propose a **distribution matching-based dataset distillation framework** that jointly optimizes both geometric structures and orientations of synthetic 3D point clouds.  

**Key contributions:**  
- **Semantically Aligned Distribution Matching (SADM):** Introduces feature sorting within each channel to mitigate semantic misalignment caused by unordered point indices.  
- **Orientation-Aware Optimization:** Learns optimal rotations of synthetic 3D objects, reducing intra-class variability and improving feature alignment.  
- **Superior Generalization:** Achieves strong cross-architecture generalization across PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and Point Transformer.  

Our method consistently outperforms existing dataset distillation and coreset selection approaches on benchmarks such as ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanObjectNN.  


## Qualitative Results

We visualize the distilled synthetic datasets compared with baseline methods (DC, DM) on ModelNet40. Our method preserves the semantic structure of 3D objects (e.g., edges, corners, class-specific shapes), while existing methods tend to collapse to noisy or less informative patterns.
